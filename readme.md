Just to let you know, some exercises may be incorrect. I may have failed some or subjects may have changed too since my Piscine.

Pour information, certains exercices pourraient être incorrects. J'en ai peut-être loupé certains, ou les sujets ont peut-être changé depuis ma Piscine.

# 42-Piscine_09.2024

This is what I produced during the 42 "Piscine" entry contest. During 4 weeks non-stop, we have around one project with multiple exercises per weekday, an exam on every Friday, 3 group projects (one per week-end, optional but highly recommended), and a final group project during last week.

_Piscine from September 9th to October 4th of 2024._
